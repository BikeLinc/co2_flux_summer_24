 # CO<sub>2</sub> Flux Project - Summer 2024

This repository contains firmware, data processing scripts, and design files for the CO<sub>2</sub> Flux Chamber project (2022-2024) conducted by the Casey Air Quality Lab at Fort Lewis College. The system enables spatial monitoring of soil CO<sub>2</sub> fluxes in wildfire-affected areas using a dynamic flux chamber system with dual ELT S300-3V CO<sub>2</sub> sensors calibrated against a LICOR LI-7810 and PICARRO CRDS.
