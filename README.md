# Wildfire CO<sub>2</sub> Flux Project - Summer 2024
This directory includes scripts and data for the 2024 Summer Wildfire CO<sub>2</sub> Flux Project. Please see the repository structure section below.

# Repository Outline

**Ambient Colocation - `/ambient_colocation`**

Contains analysis scripts and datasets for greenhouse ambient colocation between ELT CO2 sensors and the Picarro instrument.

**Flux Test - `/flux_test`**

Contains set-point calculation scripts, analysis scripts, and datasets for the 1st lab flux test.

**Lab Colocation - `/lab_colocation`**

Contains analysis scripts and datasets for the lab colocation (aka dilution test) between ELT CO2 sensors and the LICOR instrument.

**Measurement Range - `/measurement_range`**

Contains scripts that simulate the mass balance model equation for a dynamic flux chamber.

**MFC 2.5 LPM Calibration w/ 400 ppm CO2 - `/mfc_calibration`**

Contains datasets for calibrating the ALICAT 2.5 L/min Mass Flow Controller for gas mixture of 400 ppm CO2, 2 ppm CH4, balanced.
